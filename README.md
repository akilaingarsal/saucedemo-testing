## ðŸš€ Setup & Run

1. Install dependencies:

## What I learn
-Writing reliable Selenium locators and handling dynamic web elements

-Designing tests with Pytest fixtures and parameterization

-Structuring code with Page Object Model for better readability and reuse

-Generating HTML reports for easier test analysis

-Managing Python dependencies with pip and requirements.txt
## Challenges faced
-**Finding the right web elements**: Sometimes buttons or fields changed their attributes, so simple locators didnâ€™t work. I had to try different ways like CSS selectors and XPath to make tests stable.

-**Organizing the code**: At first, all test code was mixed together. Learning to separate page details into classes (Page Object Model) helped keep tests clean and easier to update.

-**Checking test results carefully**: Making sure the tests actually check the right things (like confirming items added to cart or sorted correctly) took some trial and error.

-**Setting up reports**: Creating test reports that are easy to read and show useful info was new to me. I worked on generating HTML reports with pytest-html.
